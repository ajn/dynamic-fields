Description:
    Generate a migration file for a specific Model using DynamicFields

Usage:
    Pass the name of the Model using DynamicFields, either CamelCased or under_scored

Examples:
    rails generate dynamic_fields:migration Post
        
        If the Post model has no table yet, will create a migration called "create_posts"
        containing a create_table migration. However, if the Post model already has a table, 
        will create a migration called "update_posts" containing all the add_column and 
        remove_column migrations.
